App-Framework-Base-Allegro5
===========================

A application level framework for Allegro 5

##	ABOUT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The set of files in this repository are designed for those seeking a foundation for a cross platform software user interface. The Allegro library enables this. The foundation files in this repository allows you to apply certain parts of the Allegro library at a higher level. The areas this foundation tool set address concerns setting up a application process and windows in a standardized manner.

##	REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need the Allegro Library version 5 to apply this foundation tool set out of the box. You can download the Allegro library from their website and build it for Mac, Windows, or Linux. The Allegro library is primarily in the C programming language whereas the tool set in this repository uses C++ to abstract fundamental parts of the library into a higher level.

##	USING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The files are not intended to be used in a software project without modification. Your windows will be unique and your pattern for use will differ from the example set in this tool set. Rather, the header files, and code will give you a pre-built solution that you can adjust for your situation to create a cross-platform C++ application using Allegro 5.
